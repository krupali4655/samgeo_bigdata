# LangSAM Segmentation App

This project introduces an interactive web application for performing semantic segmentation on geospatial imagery using natural language prompts. Built with Streamlit and powered by the LangSAM model from the `samgeo` library, the app is designed to help researchers, analysts, and developers analyze satellite and aerial images more intuitively. Instead of requiring technical segmentation parameters or manual input masks, users can simply upload a GeoTIFF file and describe the target feature using plain languageâ€”such as "buildings", "roads", "vegetation", or "water bodies". The model then automatically segments relevant features from the image based on the provided prompt.At the heart of the application is the LangSAM (Language Segment Anything Model), which fuses the capabilities of language understanding with image segmentation. LangSAM enables the model to semantically interpret user-provided text and associate it with image regions that match the prompt. To efficiently process large geospatial rasters, the application divides the input image into smaller tiles using the `split_raster` function. This step ensures that memory usage is optimized and that the segmentation can be performed on each tile individually. The segmented tiles are then merged back into a single raster to produce a unified output. The application uses the `leafmap` library to offer an interactive visualization experience. Once segmentation is complete, the original image and the segmented result are both displayed on a dynamic map interface within the Streamlit app. The segmented raster is styled with a customizable color palette and can be explored visually, while the associated shapefile output provides vector-based delineation of the segmented regions. Users can download both the segmented GeoTIFF and the shapefile directly from the interface, making it easy to integrate the results into GIS workflows or spatial analyses.
From a technical perspective, the application leverages a combination of geospatial libraries such as `rasterio`, `shapely`, and `leafmap`, along with general-purpose Python utilities for file handling and I/O operations. Temporary directories are created for storing intermediate outputs, ensuring that user-uploaded files and processing results do not persist beyond the session. The model supports various parameters such as `box_threshold` and `text_threshold` to fine-tune the segmentation sensitivity and relevance.
To use the application, users simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and launch the Streamlit server. A web interface will open in the browser, prompting the user to upload an image and enter a segmentation prompt. The segmentation process is initiated with a single click and typically completes within seconds, depending on image size and system performance. Although the app can run on CPUs, GPU acceleration is highly recommended for faster inference, especially when processing large or high-resolution rasters.
This project is ideal for environmental monitoring, land cover analysis, disaster assessment, urban development studies, and any domain that requires rapid and user-friendly extraction of features from remotely sensed data. The code is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, allowing users to freely use, modify, and extend the application. It demonstrates how cutting-edge AI models like LangSAM can be effectively integrated into lightweight, user-centric tools for geospatial applications.

# LangSAM GeoTIFF Segmentation App

This project presents a web-based application for semantic image segmentation of geospatial raster data using natural language prompts. The application is built using Streamlit and leverages the capabilities of the `LangSAM` model from the `samgeo` library. Users can upload GeoTIFF images and enter text-based prompts such as "roads", "buildings", or "vegetation" to perform targeted segmentation tasks. The model processes the imagery in tiles for efficiency and generates both raster and vector outputs that highlight regions matching the textual description.

At the core of the application is the LangSAM model, which integrates language understanding with image segmentation. This allows users to specify regions of interest in plain language without needing to define detailed parameters or manual boundaries. Once a GeoTIFF is uploaded and a prompt is provided, the app automatically tiles the input image and applies LangSAM's batch prediction function to each tile. The results are then merged, visualized, and converted to vector format (Shapefile) for download or further analysis.

The application uses the `leafmap` library for interactive visualization. Users can explore both the original and segmented images side by side on a dynamic map interface. This facilitates immediate visual feedback and ensures that the segmentation aligns with user expectations. The output files, including a segmented GeoTIFF and a corresponding Shapefile, are made available for download directly through the app.

To run the application locally, users need to clone the repository, install the required Python packages, and launch the Streamlit app. The interface is intuitive and designed for ease of use, even for users with limited programming experience. This project is ideal for researchers, analysts, and developers working with remote sensing data, environmental monitoring, or urban planning, who seek a quick and flexible tool for geospatial image segmentation.

The application is open source and released under the MIT License. It is built on top of powerful geospatial Python libraries including `samgeo`, `leafmap`, and `rasterio`, and is optimized for systems with GPU support to enhance inference speed.
